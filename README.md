Repository of processed data used in manuscript entitled
"Population size and centrality effects on NO2 air pollution across and within European cities"
submitted for publication
by Yufei Wei, RÃ©mi Lemoy and Geoffrey Caruso.

The processed data from which regressions and graphics were made is available in the form of two csv files:
WeiCarusoLemoy_G_NO2.csv for ground based NO2 concentrations
WeiCarusoLemoy_C_NO2.csv for TROPOMI based NO2 concentrations

Variables in WeiCarusoLemoy_G_NO2.csv:

"FUAId" and "FUAName" id of urban areas (based on GHSL FUA eFUA_ID and eFUA_name);
"StationX" and "StationY" coordinates of monitoring station;                  
"NO2AveGround" NO2 concentration (year daily average, in micro g per cubic m);
"Dist" distance to main centre (town hall (in house dataset assembled by Lemoy Caruso and Kilgarriff));
"Pop2015" population size (based on GHSL FUA);
"CBDX" and "CBDY" coordinates of main centre;
"StationBackgrd" type of station background NO2 (categories: Background" (mixed reference), Traffic or Industrial)

Variables in WeiCarusoLemoy_C_NO2.csv:

"FUAId" and "FUAName" id of urban areas (based on GHSL FUA eFUA_ID and eFUA_name);
"CellX" and "CellY" coordinates of cells;                  
"NO2AveSatellite" NO2 concentration (year daily average, in micro moles per sq m);
"Dist" distance to main centre (town hall (in house dataset assembled by Lemoy Caruso and Kilgarriff));
"Pop2015" population size (based on GHSL FUA);
"CBDX" and "CBDY" coordinates of main centre;
"Cmin" background NO2 (min of NO2AveSatellite for each city)
